I use her in my imagination to represent the cells of my immune system as they rid my body of invaders such as viruses and bacteria.  Just the thought of her helps me feel better.

This personal army can cleanse your lungs of foreign particles, rid your bloodstream of infectious viruses and bacteria, and destroy cancer cells.  Your immune system cells are born in your bone marrow, move into your bloodstream, and are known as white blood cells.  They are what helps you fight off a cold, flu, sore throat, or ear infection.  They are the cells that rush to a paper cut on your finger causing it to be a bit red and swollen as they do their work fighting off any bacterial invaders at the site of the cut.  Immune system cells do their jobs in various ways: eating the invaders, engulfing them, blowing them up so they explode, paralyzing them and squashing them so they die. Then they are flushed out of your system or are eaten as waste.  They communicate with each other, letting each other know when an invader is present and how many cells are needed for the fight.  They even tell each other when the job is done and that fewer fighting cells are needed.  Even more amazing, scientists now know that immune system cells learn new behavior and that they can grow in number and in concentration when people relax deeply, use visual imagery, and help themselves feel better in a variety of ways, such as exercising, eating well, and using social support.","icon":false},{"list":[],"bold":false,"text":"My immune system cells are my sentries, forever moving about my body and guarding me against invaders.

They are a normal part of life, just like bacteria and viruses are. Having some around feels healthy to me, but having too many is not.  When my polar bears swat and eat the fish, they are big, aggressive, purposeful, and strong, but not cruel. I see the fish coming together in schools and then not surviving the attack.
